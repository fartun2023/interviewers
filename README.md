# Interview Applicant Checker
This project provides a simple JavaScript application to determine if an applicant's age falls within the acceptable range for an interview. The application consists of two main functions:

acceptForinterview(age): Checks if the given age is within the range of 12 to 30 inclusive.
checkAPPLICANT(): Prompts the user to enter the applicant's age, validates the input, and outputs the result of the interview acceptance check.
